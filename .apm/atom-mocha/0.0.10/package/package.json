Although this might change in the future.\n\nYou see the problem with using a local version of mocha is that atom-mocha might\nnot work as expected, and there would be no way to assure it does.\nBy bundling the a version of mocha with this package atom-mocha can ensure that it\ncan run properly.\n\n\n# Features\n\nYou: Ok ok... that's all well and good but can you tell what this thing can do?\n\nMe: Ofc. Here's a small list a features.\n\n- Can run tests from just about anywhere\n    - context menu on .js files (Run Test)\n    - context menu on folder (Run Tests)\n    - ALT  + SHIFT + T (Run Test - Current File)\n    - CTRL + SHIFT + R (Re-run last test)\n- Navigate to source from stack trace (click on the trace item)\n- Tree view of tests\n- Nice little stats view (in the top right corner) with elapsed time and number of passed/failed/pending tests\n\n\n# Installation\n\nYou: hmm, not bad. But how do I install it?\n\nMe: Glad you asked.\n\n~~For now installation is a bit trickier then regular packages, since its not published.~~\n\n~~cd <somewhere where you want to have the package>~~\n~~git clone https://github.com/boogie666/atom-mocha.git~~\n~~cd atom-mocha~~\n~~apm install~~\n\n~~And you should be good.~~\n\n~~Me: I hope to get the package published soon, just as soon as I figure out how :)~~\n\nIt's the regular way now :)\n\n# Contributing\n\nYou: Can I help?\n\nMe: Sure.\n\n\nFork and submit pull requests.\nI'd be more then happy to have people contribute to this nifty little tool i've been working on :)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/boogie666/atom-mocha/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/boogie666/atom-mocha#readme","_id":"atom-mocha@0.0.10","_shasum":"8e39c3c4e93848f84f3aa11583955769c6caed26","_resolved":"file:../d-117230-74975-b7z8de/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117230-74975-b7z8de/package.tgz"}
